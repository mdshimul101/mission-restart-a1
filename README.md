1) What is the difference between null and undefined?

2) What is the use of the map() function in JavaScript? How is it different from forEach()?
Ans : If we don't want to change the original array, we can use map(), which returns a new array. On the other hand, forEach() is also an array method, but it only executes a function for each element and does not return a new array.

3) What is the difference between == and ===?
Ans : == check only the value but === check value and type.

4) What is the significance of async/await in fetching API data?
Ans : async/await make asynchronous code look and behave like synchronous code, making it easier to read and manage.

Code looks synchronous and easier to understand, better error handling with try/catch , avoids callback hell or long .then() chains,
works perfectly with multiple asynchronous calls
